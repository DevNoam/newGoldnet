To replace EXE data there are some steps that need to be done:

Use ResourceHacker to change the EXE strings (Does not support Hebrew out of the box).

Use 'dede' to dump all dmf files when we want to use Hebrew.

Use dfmedit to edit the dmf files.

Use Lazarus IDE to create Image code for delphi.

Process of replacing an image for an EXE:
1. Dump all the dmf's files using dede, export the required file to a dmf.
2. Load the dmf file to dmfedit.
3. Create a BMP image that is similar to the original file inside the exe in terms of size.
4. Create a Lazarus project that contains a Timage with the BMP image, and compile to an exe.
5. Use resource hacker to copy the Image binaries (Picture.data).
6. Copy the image binary into the bmfedit form by replacing the binaries data.
7. Export the bmf.
8. Import the wanted exe to resource hacker.
9. Replace the form with the new dmf file we generated
10. Compile a new EXE.

Replacing an image and data is complex process which takes time. But possible with some dedication to the process.
To sum, We need to create a new Binary image using a new project, copy the binary and replace it with the original exe. since resource hacker doesn't let us edit hebrew forms, we need to use a workaround using dmfedit and dede to make us a dmf files.
